# Superpowers fTween plugin

This plugin for [Superpowers, the extensible HTML5 2D+3D game engine](http://sparklinlabs.com), exposes the `fTween` and `SPTWEEN` modules to the runtime.

`SPTWEEN` is the [superpowers-tween.js JS library](https://github.com/florentpoujol/superpowers-tween.js), a fork of the popular `tween.js` library while `fTween` is a nice wrapper (with mostly the `fTween.Tween` class) around it to make things a lot easier to use in your game code.

Just so that you don't get confused, be aware that the `tweenjs` plugin (by SparklinLabs, Superpowers' devs) exposes `TWEEN` (the original tween.js) and the `Tween` actor component.
